## ðŸ“– Problem Statement

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

## ðŸ“– Data Summary

Dataset contains following features:

â€¢ Date : year-month-day

â€¢ Rented Bike count - Count of bikes rented at each hour

â€¢ Hour - Hour of the day

â€¢ Temperature-Temperature in Celsius

â€¢ Humidity - %

â€¢ Windspeed - m/s

â€¢ Visibility - 10m

â€¢ Dew point temperature - Celsius

â€¢ Solar radiation - MJ/m2

â€¢ Rainfall - mm

â€¢ Snowfall - cm

â€¢ Seasons - Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn

â€¢ Holiday - Holiday/No holiday

â€¢ Functional Day - NoFunc(Non Functional Hours), Fun(Functional hours)

## ðŸ“– Tools and Libraries Used


We have used Python 3 to its following packages:

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
4. Sklearn

## ðŸ“– Conclusion

In our analysis, we initially did EDA on all the features of our datset. 

Next we implemented four machine learning algorithms Linear Regression,Ridge(L2), Lasso(L1), Random Forest Regressor. We did some hyperparameter tuning to improve our model performance.

Out of all above models Random forest Regressor gives the highest R2 score of 91% for test Set.
No overfitting is seen.

So the bike rental company can deploy a machine learning model that uses Random Forest Regressor to predict the demand for city bikes for a particular hour, which can help the company meet the demand accurately. On the contrary when the company predicts to be a low demand day/season, the bikes can be sent to maintainance.
